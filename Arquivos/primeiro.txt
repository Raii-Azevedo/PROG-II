Kiss Me More (feat. SZA)
We hug and yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight (la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

(Can you kiss me more?)
We're so young, boy
We ain't got nothin' to lose, oh, oh
(It's just principle)
Baby, hold me
'Cause I like the way you groove, oh, oh
